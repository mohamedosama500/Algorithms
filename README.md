# Algorithms

-> Breadth first search:

	- BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level. It processes each node, then enqueues all its neighbors,
		ensuring that nodes at the same level are visited before moving to the next level.
		
		
-> Depth first search:


	- DFS uses recursion to explore as deep as possible first. The function keeps calling itself for unvisited neighbors.
